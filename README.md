This Python script applies an Instagram-style filter to an image using the instafilter library. The script initializes the Instafilter class with a "lo-fi" filter and then applies this filter to an image named image.jpg. The resulting image is saved as modified_image.jpg using the cv2 library. To use this script, ensure you have the instafilter and opencv-python libraries installed, place the image you want to filter in the same directory as the script, and run the script. The filtered image will be saved in the same directory with the name modified_image.jpg.
